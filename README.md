# Clinical Safety Risk Flag Tool

**Clinically informed decision support prototype for identifying silent patient safety risks, informed by contemporary patient safety and early warning guidelines.**

---

## Overview
This project is a prototype clinical decision support tool designed to demonstrate how silent and cumulative patient safety risks can be identified early using simple, explainable, rule-based logic.

The tool aims to support healthcare teams by making subtle risk patterns more visible and actionable, without replacing clinical judgment or local protocols.
